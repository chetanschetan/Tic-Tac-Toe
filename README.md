# Tic-Tac-Toe
I created a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This game is for two players. One player plays X and the other plays O. The players take turns placing their marks on a grid of three-by-three cells. If a given player gets three marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, then that player wins the game.


# This is how our game will look like...
If a button is clicked, It will get disabled automatically so that the player can't click the same button again until the RESET button is clicked.
